# GoScratch

This project is a recreation of the visual programming language Scratch made by MIT. GoScratch is made in Go and has almost unlimited possibilities by combining the strengths of a compiled language with the ease of a visual one.Â 

Currently this project is **not complete**, and I am hard at work on it!
